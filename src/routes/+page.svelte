	<h1>The Map Manifesto Draft</h1>
	<p>The current system for TTRPG map is fundamentaly broken.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>No good way for users or creators to access all their maps and subscriptions </li>
		<li>Platforms take large percentages from creators while providing mediocre support</li>
		<li>No easy way for creators to protect their libraries</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>
        What is this nonsense about
    </h2>
	<p>
		This page servers as a first draft for what the website will be about. However it also serves the purpose of learning to dockerize svelte. If you are seeing this I have not figured it out yet.
	</p>
    <p>
        Back in summer 2021 I had an idea of a site actually for artists. Inspired by drivers.coop in NYC, a mission to make a place where the goal is to keep as much of the money in creators pockets.
        A goal to target sustainability and longterm thinking without shareholders and such. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Focused on building a proper lasting ecosytem. A more symbiotic relationship between the site and the creators as a site is nothing without them. So why try to piss them off?
    </p>
    <h2> What effort is being made </h2>
    <p> A protoype has been made, a map serving website you could subscribe to creators and manage a easy shared library of all your favorites.
        A improved version is being developed and I plan to release more detail soon. This site serves as a test of setting up CI/CD for a site. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This site will be using a fully opensource stack that is host agnositc in order to minimize cost. Taking the effort to build sound systems that are affordable yet reliable. 
        I understand these are lofty claims and I ask nothing from you,I mearly hope my actions prove I truly intend to honor my words. Thank you for reading.
